We live in an amazing time. Never before has nearly all human information been so readily available to such a large group of people.
This opens a unique opportunity. On one hand, generative AI will make consumption easier than ever. We will have tailored algorithms 
and advertisements so attuned to our thoughts and preferences that it will be nearly impossible to break free of the scroll.
This will result in large amounts of humans and children dwindling down to an existence that is purely consumption. Imagine Wall-E.
On the other hand however, for the curious, mastery of levels we have never seen will be possible. Children can start at a younger age, learning
higher quality material, and ultimately this will result in a new generation of extremely talented individuals.
The gap, however, between those who wield AI and those who are consumed by it will also create the largest gap in society that we have ever seen.
It has therefore never been more important to be an Outler - someone who is exceptionally talented in a certain area.
To he who has, more will be given, and he who has not, even what little he has will be taken away.
